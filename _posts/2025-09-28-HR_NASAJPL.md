    Marriage is one of the most important rituals in Oromo culture. The custom of marriage differs in various parts of the world and every civilization produces a marriage pattern appropriate to itself (Ludlow, 1965, cited in Gemechu & Assefa., 2006). Among the Oromo society also the type, name and ceremonies differ to some degree from place to place. Generally, there are three types of marriage among the Oormo.

    Brief piece by Tigist Geme*.

Marriage is one of the most important rituals in Oromo culture. The custom of marriage differs in various parts of the world and every civilization produces a marriage pattern appropriate to itself (Ludlow, 1965, cited in Gemechu & Assefa., 2006). Among the Oromo society also the type, name and ceremonies differ to some degree from place to place. Generally, there are three types of marriage among the Oromo.

a) Formal marriage

This type of marriage has different names in different parts of Oromia: ‘kadhaa’ (Nuro,1989), or fuudha baal-tokkee (Hussen 2000) around Arsi, ‘cida’ (Lemmesa, 2007) around Showa, and ‘Naqataa’ (Gemetchu & Assefa, 2006) in Wallaga. ‘Kadhaa’ or ‘naqataa’ is the most typical and prevalent form of marriage where the ceremony starts at the moment when marriage is first thought of and even continues after the marriage is concluded (Gemetchu & Assefa, 2006).

Traditionally, it is arranged by family and before the match takes place, they make sure that the girl’s family does not have members who are lepers, chawa-clan, crafts men such as tanner, potter etc. The groom’s parents research back seven generations to make sure that the families are not related by blood, to avoid haraamuu or incest taboo. Once this has been done, the boy’s parents then make contact with the girl’s parents through a mediator. The girl’s parents often impose conditions and the mediator will take the message to the boys parents. When the parents have reached an agreement, the man and woman get engaged (betrothed). The parent then set a wedding date and they meet all the wedding expenses (Nuro,1989, Gemechu & Assefa 2006).

b) Informal Marriage

i) Hawwii

According to Gemechu & Assefa (2006), this mode of marriage occurs when the boy happens to remain qeerroo (bachelor) for several reasons. Either because he is not handsome, or he is from a family of low social status, and therefore cannot pay the dowry. The boy has no consent of the family of the girl to wait long and to meet the financial and social demands of the girl’s parents. Sometimes, the girl’s mother is involved in arranging marriage of her daughter through hawwee. It is common among poor people. Youngsters resort to this kind of marriage after a lot of period of courtship that the boy approaches whom he thinks can keep secret to act on a go-between. There are places where the boy and the girl with their company can mostly wait each other. She signs an agreement saying that she was not taken against her will and she will be taken to one of the boy’s relatives until his parent prepares feast for marriage (Gemechu & Assefa2006, Nuro,1989), and that her parents are solemnly informed about her safety by elders.

ii) Buttaa/Butii

This type of marriage takes of the following two forms. The first is when the girl has consented she is induced to be abducted. The second is accomplished by compulsion without any prior knowledge of the abduction (unlike the first form) on the part of the girl (Gemechu & Assefa, 2006).

As Gemechu and Assefa point it out in their co-authored article on the Western Macca Oromo Marriage Style, marriage by abduction is taken as option when:

1) a boy falls in love and she is not aware at all.

2) a girl’s parent is affriad that their daoughter might agree to the proposed marriage,they consprice with the would be husband to take her by force.

3) a girl’s parent are unwilling to agree to the proposed marriage, abduction would be resorted by boy’s family to show that they have a power to take her by force evenif her parents refused (Gemechu & Assefa, 2006; Nuro, 1989).

This informal marriage was also observable among the Salale before the government intervention and the customary law became renewed in a way committed to preserving women’s right and security.

iii) Aseennaa

This type of marriage employs peaceful, but cunning means. According to Nuro (1989), when a girl could not get anybody who seeks her hand in marriage because she may be an ugly or her parent has an evil eye “as said to be” by the society, she chooses anyone whom she thinks would marry her. And she directly goes to his parent’s house. Gemechu & Assefa (2006) also explained that, for a women to remain unmarried into her twenties is incomprehensible, though, she must go beyond herself, called aseennaa. Therefore, when a girl is left unmarried or when her father wants to give her to some one whom she does not like, she chooses unmarried young man and runs a way to his house withought the knoweledge of the man mostly in the evening.

iv) Conditional marriage

This type of marriage depends on the occurrence of certain incidents.

a) Dhaala

Dhaala is a type of marriage between a women and a brother of a deceased husband or levirate (Gemechu & Assefa 2006). Among such a patrilineal community where marriage secures children to perpetuate the father’s line, it is usual for widow to be inherited by a brother of a deceased husband (Nuro,1989).

b) Mambeeto (manbeeto)

Its conditionality is the death of one’s wife. The younger sister or relative of the late wife would be given to the widower as soon as the first wife dies (Nuro, 1989). It is known as manbeeto or mambeeto among Arsi. Among the Oromo of Tulama and Macca it is known as hirpha, literally, to ‘compensate’.

# Longtime Southern California NASA engineer, space mission manager dies at 92 [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Social-@KTLA__-blue?style=social&logo=X)](https://twitter.com/@KTLA)
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Casani) : [Talk @whitehouse @nasa @nasa-jpl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_R._Casani) : [NASAWATCH.cOm John Casani (Update)](https://nasawatch.com/personnel-news/john-casani/)
John R. Casani, a longtime Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer, project manager and researcher, died at the age of 92 last week. 

Casani served a central role in many of NASA’s historic deep space missions, the space agency said in a statement.  

Born in Philadelphia in 1932, Casani studied electrical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and worked at an Air Force research lab before he moved to SoCal to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, way back in 1956, two years before NASA itself was formed. 

He went on to become an engineer on some of America’s earliest spacecraft after initially working on missiles. He worked on the design team for the Ranger and Mariner series of spacecraft and was a payload engineer on Pioneer 3 and 4 – NASA’s first two missions to the moon; he was tasked with the very important job of carrying each of the 20-inch probes in a suitcase from JPL to the launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where he installed them in the rocket’s nose cone.

By the time the mid 1960s rolled around, Casani had established himself as a “meticulous” worker and started working on the design team for the Mariner project. Shortly after, he helped lead NASA’s flagship mission to the outer planets and beyond: Voyager, which is still active today. 

“He not only led the mission from clean room to space, he was first to envision attaching a message representing humanity to any alien civilization that might encounter humanity’s first interstellar emissaries,” NASA’s statement reads.

Casani presented that idea to famed astronomer Carl Sagan, who ended up making the “Golden Record,” a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on earth, according to NASA.  

Voyager 1 and 2 both launched in 1977, meaning that Casani – described as “an engineer’s engineer” — was quickly shuttled to the Galileo team, the first mission to orbit a gas giant planet. He led the project from inception to assembly while navigating several attempts by Congress to end the project.

After leading Galileo for 11 years, Casani became a deputy assistant laboratory director for flight projects in 1988 before being promoted just over a year later to serve as project manager of Cassini, which was NASA’s flagship mission to orbit Saturn. He was then named as JPL’s first chief engineer in 1994, a role in which he served for five years before retiring, temporarily. 

In retirement, Casani served on several committees and helped conduct investigations into the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander failures. He also led the James Webb Space Telescope Independent Comprehensive Review Panel.

By 2003, however, Casani was back at JPL serving as project manager for Project Prometheus, which was the first attempt at nuclear-powered systems for long-range missions. The project was canceled in 2005.  

After the cancelation of Prometheus, Casani was appointed as the manager of the Institutional Special Projects Office at JPL, which was a position he held until his second retirement in 2012.

“[John’s] work helped advance NASA spacecraft in areas including mechanical technology, system design and integration, software and deep space communication,” NASA’s statement reads. “No less demanding were the management challenges of these multifaceted missions, which led to innovations still in use today.” 

Charles Elachi, the JPL director from 2001 through 2016, said Casani “reflected the true spirit of JPL.” 

“He was bold, innovative, visionary and welcoming,” Elachi said in the NASA statement. “He was an undisputed leader with an upbeat, fun attitude and left an indelible mark on the laboratory and NASA. I am proud to have called him a friend.”

In addition to his impressive résumé, Casani received many awards throughout his long career, including NASA’s Exceptional Achievement Medal and the Air and Space Museum Trophy for Lifetime Achievement. He also received an honorary doctorate from the Sapienza University of Rome.

The 92-year-old, who died Thursday, is survived by his wife of 39 years, Lynn, and their five sons. A cause of death was not revealed.

## Forms_of_wartime_violence
# Wartime Sexual Violence [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_sexual_violence) [Genocidal rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocidal_rape) [War rape - psychology.fandom](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/War_rape)
 <img src="https://16days.thepixelproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/War-rape.jpg" style="width:400px;height:600px;margin-left:15px;" align="right" alt="Pineapple" /> 
<p>Wartime sexual violence is rape or other forms of sexual violence committed by combatants during armed conflict, war, or military occupation often as spoils of war, but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include gang rape and rape with objects. A war crime, it is distinguished from sexual harassment, sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service.[1][2][3]</p>
<p>During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy. Wartime sexual violence may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalized sexual slavery, wartime sexual violence associated with specific battles or massacres, as well as individual or isolated acts of sexual violence.</p>
<p>Rape can also be recognized as genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. International legal instruments for prosecuting perpetrators for genocide were developed in the 1990s, with the Akayesu case of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda being widely considered as a precedent.[4] However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for international conflicts, thus putting the burden of proof in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.</p>
<p>## Definition of wartime sexual violence # Main article: Rape There is no consensus definition of wartime sexual violence, as there is variance in what forms of violence are included in the definition and variance in which violence is considered conflict-related.[5] The terms rape, sexual assault and sexual violence are frequently used interchangeably.[6] The Explanatory Note of the Rome Statute, which binds the International Criminal Court, defines rape as follows: </p><p> The perpetrator invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body.[7] and The invasion was committed by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment, or the invasion was committed against a person incapable of giving genuine consent.[7] </p><p>The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral and the definition is understood to include situations where the victim may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity.[8] A prominent data-set on conflict-related sexual violence, Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict (SVAC), builds on the ICC definition and covers seven forms of violence: "(a) rape, (b) sexual slavery, (c) forced prostitution, (d) forced pregnancy, (e) forced sterilization/abortion, (f) sexual mutilation, and (g) sexual torture."[5] The data-set defines conflict-related sexual violence as the sexual violence committed "armed actors (specifically, state militaries, rebel groups, and progovernment militias) during periods of conflict or immediately postconflict," thus excluding sexual violence by civilians.[5] More expansive definitions may define wartime sexual violence as being committed even by civilians if the conflict creates a sense of impunity.[5]</p>

I have no problem with her relationship status, but it left me crippled fiscally and immobile, i was 3 weeks late on my car payment and her boyfriend stole my honda fit. I had to let the mustang go for a Title loan bc the car was getting poisoned and i could not afford to commute in it. At least i would have the warranty with the new car. I had no carpayment b4. I get fired as soon as i get comfortable. Since i have a past with NAsa its hard to get work bc im not into porn. But I was advised that I was [Mars Mission Staff](https://github.com/nasa)! The people at the library are stingy with Computer time but the military is doing a silent workforce healing because we can be tracked via [GitHub](https://www.github.careers/careers-home)

If im working on Github and creating usable code im healthy with my employer. I have a contractor issue. Mori's Jose M Pi told me that I could not come back to the Military Base because I was late too often. Our Extended Stay room was getting poisoned and I was taking care of my child fulltime and had worked things out with the mission. I put her in a holistic daycare in Altedena with ponys and had a schedule to make sure she played outside. I have workedd Development Opeerations(Devops) most of my life and a computer is like your radio. Im isolated ive always depended on my employer for a steady connection to the internet, and my life organically grew around it. [Read about my victimization](https://thakarashard.github.io/ricothaka/worknotes#Mori) and bullying by the world of Criminal sex and striptease after I took a year off. No one ever belived I worked! And im always kicked off of social media and no one will talk to me. I think the lady in this video who is [removing my child](https://www.facebook.com/CaptainOfJoy/videos/1826699194158396) is a local sex slave. She is my friend at the very least. Here is the [DekalbCounty Court](https://www.facebook.com/CaptainOfJoy/videos/1826699224158393) removing my child with no notice! I was tossed in the Mental hospital about 3 months later. I was made homeless in stages! Im sacred and need help! [here is some of the story i compiled for Arcadia Police](https://thakarashard.github.io/compiling/Update-Arcadia-Police). Im getting wordy but The girl that took my child, i think it's [Normani](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/normani-cancels-bet-awards-performance-injury_n_6682d314e4b038babc7c6b01). I dont know to what extent but im intimate with her. Erika left me... And Normani has been life coaching me in certain areas. I signed a contract with her under the name Dyneesha... She goes by Kashdoll sometimes and keeps a check on my libraries and other things she getpoints for. Kinda like you guys and speeding tickets [Mashonga](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1826797320815250&set=pb.100004549987965.-2207520000&type=3)
